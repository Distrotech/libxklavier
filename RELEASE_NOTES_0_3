The third development release of libxklavier XKB utility library.

Now libxklavier is in a nearly "feature freeze"/"API freeze" state till 1.0
release.

Since the only using it application (gswitchit toolkit) is going to have
massive architectural changes associated with porting to GNOME 2 platform, no
major changes are planned for the nearest future. Sure, if anyone would be
interested in adding something useful...

This version adds some extra configuration handling sugar. Now an application
can backup and restore XKB configuration using X root window's properties in a
generic way. The standard way X Window is doing this (in "_XKB_RULES_NAMES"
property only) is not generic enough. Now an application can be sure that the
property  "_XKB_RULES_NAMES_BACKUP" contains the original XKB configuration,
straight from XF86Config (taking that XklBackupNamesProp is called properly).
Also, any arbitrary property can be used to keep XKB configuration - if
necessary. 

About the deadlines. I think 1.0 is not going to be released before the
XFree86 version which would incorporate multiple layouts, XML-based
configuration registry (now in xfree86_xkb_xml). Only after that great event,
some testing and user feedback, the world will hopefully see libxklavier 1.0.

Some fixes for the latest gcc/autoconf/automake were done too.
