The maintenance/bugfix release of libxklavier XKB utility library.

- Some minor API/ABI changes (sorry for new .so version). In particular, ability to use custom logging callback.

- Usage of pkgconfig (libxklavier.pc created)

- Little fixes and polishing (related to GSwitchIt applet reincarnation as a shared library)
