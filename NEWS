1.11	A lot of internal changes. VTable introduced (so now at some 
	point there can be implemented xmodmap backend). Some bugs were 
	fixed.
1.10	Some internal reorganization in the xklavier-config department.
	API/ABI are broken. All this stuff is going to be used in 
	GNOME 2.9x. The environment variable XKL_DEBUG introduced in 
	order to control the debug info more handy. Minor portability 
	bug was fixed.
1.04	Some memory leaks were nailed (thanks to kmaraas and valgrind).
	Default ruleset for partially non-compliant servers introduced
	(though it still long way to go for AccelleratedX support).
	A couple of small tests introduced.
	Hopefully the last release in 1.0x series.
