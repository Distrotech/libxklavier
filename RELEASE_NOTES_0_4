The forth development release of libxklavier XKB utility library.

Libxklavier is in a nearly "feature freeze"/"API freeze" state till 1.0
release (not earlier than XFree86 4.3.0 release).

This maintenance release fixes one major bag (which could cause some crashes) 
and one possible memory leak. Also, some code/headers reorganization was 
done - all the header files include all the necessary system headers 
(X11/X???.h) themselves.

Users of libxklavier 0.3 are strongly advised to upgrade.
